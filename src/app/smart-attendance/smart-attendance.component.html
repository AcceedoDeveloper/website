            <h3>Enterprise-Grade Attendance Management for Large Industries</h3>
            <p class="content-text overlay-text">
              Our Smart Biometric Attendance & Payroll System is engineered to handle 
              the complex workforce demands of large-scale industries, including 
              manufacturing plants, multi-shift operations, and geographically 
              dispersed teams. With high-speed facial recognition and fingerprint 
              authentication, the system can process thousands of check-ins per hour 
              without bottlenecks, ensuring seamless attendance tracking even in 
              high-traffic environments. Multi-location support allows centralized
               monitoring of all sites, while real-time synchronization ensures data 
               consistency across departments. 
               <br><br>
               The system automatically adapts to 
               varying shift patterns—including rotating, night, and split shifts—while
                enforcing strict compliance with labor regulations. Advanced AI-driven 
                analytics detect attendance patterns, predict manpower shortages, and 
                optimize shift scheduling for maximum productivity.
