          Project Last Mile works with a national Ministry of Health in enhancing
          the work they have already done in improving the health system capacity.
          Heat Treatment Monitor tracks energy consumption for every cycle, providing 
          detailed data on power usage. This helps identify energy-saving opportunities 
          and ensures efficient operation. <br><br>
          Monitoring energy per cycle also aids in cost 
          analysis and sustainability efforts.                Energy efficiency recommendations in power metrics involve analyzing energy consumption data to identify opportunities for reducing waste and optimizing usage. By assessing patterns in power usage, the system suggests improvements such as adjusting operating schedules, upgrading equipment, or implementing energy-saving technologies.

          Energy efficiency recommendations in power metrics are insights derived from analyzing energy usage patterns to identify opportunities for reducing consumption and optimizing performance. These recommendations are based on data collected from power meters, which highlight areas of inefficiency, such as excessive energy usage during peak hours or poorly performing equipment.<br><br>
