            <h2>Heat Treatment Device</h2>
            <p>In industries where metals and materials are heated above 500Â°C and then rapidly cooled during quenching, maintaining precise temperature profiles is critical. Our device tracks every stage of this process from the initial heating phase, through temperature holding periods, and into the quenching stage where rapid cooling occurs. <br><br>
          <!-- With built-in sensors and real-time monitoring, the device records the exact temperature data throughout the cycle and transmits this information directly to a centralized server. This ensures that no deviation goes unnoticed, and every process step is documented for quality control and compliance purposes.  -->
