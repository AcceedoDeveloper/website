          Energy efficiency recommendations in power metrics are insights derived from analyzing energy usage patterns to identify opportunities for reducing consumption and optimizing performance. These recommendations are based on data collected from power meters, which highlight areas of inefficiency, such as excessive energy usage during peak hours or poorly performing equipment.

          By using these insights, users can implement strategies like adjusting usage schedules, upgrading inefficient devices, or modifying operational practices to lower energy consumption and reduce costs. Such recommendations help improve overall energy efficiency, minimize waste, and support sustainability goals.
