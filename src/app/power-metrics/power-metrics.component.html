              <p>
                Real-time energy tracking in power metrics involves continuously 
                monitoring and analyzing energy consumption data from power meters. 
                It provides instant feedback on energy usage patterns, helping 
                optimize efficiency. This tracking allows for the identification 
                of peak consumption times and areas of waste. It aids in making 
                data-driven decisions for energy conservation and cost reduction.
              </p>
              <p>
                Real-time energy tracking in power metrics refers to the continuous
                 monitoring and measurement of energy consumption and usage patterns 
                 as they happen, typically using smart meters and advanced energy 
                 management systems.
