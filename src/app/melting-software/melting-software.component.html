        <p class="content-text">
          Our melting software optimizes the production process by managing raw materials, alloy additions, and temperature monitoring without human contact. It automates planning, furnace selection, and charge-mix composition, providing real-time data access on mobile or computer. Key features include spectrum analysis, automatic reports, stock updates, and furnace maintenance tracking for efficient and high-quality production.
          <br><br>
          Our system software enables the professional to manage the raw material quantity, addition of alloys, spectrum result and monitor the temperature during the melting process without the need for human contact in the physical process. User can view live data anywhere on their mobile or computer.

                Planning production for customer with alloy composition and planned date. User can also change the product priority based on the customer requirements. Once the product is planned, it awaits furnace selection and chargemix composition.
              </p>
              <p>
                Available furnaces are listed for selection and the raw materials for the product are selected by the operator for loading. The charge-mix amount is automatically calculated and the required amount of pure alloy is displayed. Furnace lining, Ladle lining and heat number are recorded for better maintenance.
              </p>
              <p>
                A final report is generated to display requirements and actual data at every step of melting process, product produced in which furnace and its alloy composition and results of all tests performed on parts in the work order. Standard printers can be used to print out all required information. Support for data conversion to popular spreadsheet formats is also provided.

              Melting is a technology used for producing a product, where metal materials such as carbon and silicon are melted together at a high temperature to yield a product. A small amount of impurity is added to the pure component to create a high quality product. Melting depends on the amount to melt and properties of the metals, and the melting process is performed under optimum conditions.
